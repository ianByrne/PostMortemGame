# Post Mortem

Post Mortem is a game that I made as part of my dissertation for a MSc in Computer Games Technology that I completed in 2021 at City, University of London. The study was titled "Can chatbots provide more immersive NPC interactions in games?".

The results were... Inconclusive.

You can play a version of the game at https://postmortem.ianbyrne.net, however that game is slightly different to what's hosted in this repo, which is the version that was submitted as part of the dissertation. I have no idea if this repo even builds - the latest commits were all made during a time of stress and last minute panic that I've since blanked from my memory. 12 months on and looking back at some of the code now, I can only shake my head. But hey, I graduated (and with a distinction to boot!), so I guess it did the job when it needed to!

Post Mortem was created using the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org), with a [ChatScript](https://github.com/ChatScript/ChatScript) backend to handle the NPC interactions. The idea is that you can type whatever you like to the NPCs, as though they were chatbots.
