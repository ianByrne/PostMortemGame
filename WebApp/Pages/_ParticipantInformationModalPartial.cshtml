                This game is part of a research study. Before you decide whether you would like to take part it is important that you understand why the research is being done and what it would involve for you. Please take time to read the following information carefully. [PLEASE NOTE THAT DURING THIS PLAY TEST PHASE, NONE OF THE DATA RECORDED DURING THIS SESSION WILL BE USED IN THE FINAL STUDY]

                What is the purpose of the study?
                This is a study to measure player immersion in games. Data will be collected from participants over several weeks before being collated, analysed, and published as part of a post graduate dissertation assignment due in Dec 2020.

                Why have I been invited to take part?
                This is an open study, available to anyone over the age of 18 who is willing to participate.

                Do I have to take part?
                Participation in the study is voluntary. If you do decide to take part, you can discontinue participation at any time during the study without needing to give a reason. All data recorded as part of the study is anonymous and you will not be asked to provide any personally identifiable information. Due to the anonymity of the data, it will not be possible to withdraw any data that has already been submitted (such as chat transcripts or survey answers). To discontinue participation, simply close this web browser. You can revisit this web page at a later time to continue participation in the study if you so choose.

                What will happen if I take part?
                You will be asked to play a game that involves exploring a small virtual world and interacting with several non-player characters who inhabit it. The game will take five to ten minutes to complete. Once completed, you will be asked to answer a series of survey questions relating to your experiences while playing the game. The survey will take about five minutes to complete.

                Your answers to the survey, as well as the transcripts of your interactions with the characters, are recorded and will be analysed as part of the study.

                What will happen to the data and results?
                This study is being conducted as part of a post graduate dissertation assignment. The anonymous data collected during this study will be made open access and could be reused in future studies which have been given ethics approval. Direct quotes from the chat transcripts could be used in the dissertation or future studies. Any personally identifiable information unintentionally recorded (such as through chat transcripts) will be manually anonymised or redacted by the research team.

                Who has reviewed the study?
                This study has been approved by the City, University of London Research Ethics Committee.

                What if there is a problem?
